### Abstract:
I added functionality for merchats to be able to utalize coupons in their sales platform.  They are now able to track what coupons have been used, what invoices they are attached to, create new coupons, and activate/deactivate coupons.

### Installation Instructions:
1 - Start by cloning down two seperate repositories the back end and the front end using the links above.
2 - Navigate to the back end directory and install your dependencies first run bundle install, and then set up the database by running rails db:{drop,create}
then rails runner ActiveRecord::Tasks::DatabaseTasks.load_seed and finally rails db:migrate
3 - While the back end is running navigate into the front end directory and run npm run dev.
4 - Now that both back end and front end servers are running open a browser and visit http://localhost:5173


### Preview of App:


### Context:
This project was kicked off on a Thursday afternoon and was due the following Tuesday evening.
Using an existing back end API and implement new funcionality with the addition of coupon features. Then connect it to a front end application.

### Learning Goals:
Learning goals were to effecively use rails to create new data tables with relationships to existing tables.  These new tables should have clean and effective routing endpoints. Fully funtional and fully tested. And be able to display all the functions to the front end.

### Wins + Challenges:
This whole thing was a challenge, but I did it
